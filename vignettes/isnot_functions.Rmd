`isnot_` functions check if a variable does not pass a certain condition.

# isnot_in

The goal of `isnot_in` is to check if a variable is not contained, it is the same as `!(x %in% y)`.

```{r isnot_in}
isnot_in("a", letters)
```

# isnot_na

The goal of `isnot_na` is to check if a variable is not a `NA` it is the same as `!is.na(x)`.

```{r isnot_na}
isnot_na(2)

isnot_na(NA)
```
