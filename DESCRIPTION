Authors@R: person("Vinícius", "Félix", email = "vinicius1b7f@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A collection of functions to help with data preparation, cleaning, and visualization. relper offers functions to: transform and format data (e.g., easily apply the percentage), compute metrics (e.g., coefficient of variation), check conditions (e.g., determine if a number is even or odd), supply lovely and varied color palettes (e.g., palettes inspired by TV series and movies), complement ggplot2 (e.g., add an identity line to a scatter plot), manipulate strings (e.g., keep only a type of character). The package's ultimate purpose is to simplify data analysis by providing functions that will shorten some steps.
