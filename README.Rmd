# Introduction

`relper` is a collection of functions that I used in the last few years of data analysis and could not find in other packages. Its purpose is to provide various functions to aid in data cleaning and visualization.

Despite not being a part of the `tidyverse` ecosystem, it has some features that complement those of packages like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.

# Installation

You can install the developer version of `relper` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("vbfelix/relper")
```
