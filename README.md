# Introduction

Relper is a collection of functions that I used in the last few years of
data analysis and could not find in other packages. Its purpose is to
provide various functions to aid in data cleaning and visualization.

Despite not being a part of the `tidyverse` ecosystem, it has some
features that complement those of packages like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.

# Installation

You can install the developer version of `relper` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("vbfelix/relper")
```
